<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>This app follows principles of Clean Architecture, and therefore is separated into three layers. Data and Presentation layers are additionally modularized, with Data layer divided by data source and Presentation layer being multi-module by feature. </p>

<h3>Domain layer</h3>

 - Contains all of the core entity classes, upon which the rest of the app is built
 - Defines interfaces of repositories
 - Encapsulates business logic inside Use Case classes

<h3>Data layer</h3>

 - Implements repositories from the domain layer
 - Fetches content from the Fit&Food API</a>
 - Stores visited products and search history in Room database
 - Uses Firebase to manage authentication and obtain data of the current user

<h3>Presentation layer</h3>
<h4>App module</h4>

- Depends on every other module to initialize DI
- Contains the application class as well as the main activity
- Controls the navigation

<h4>UI feature modules</h4>

Each module is responsible for one logical feature of the app. All features implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel#:~:text=Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel%20(MVVM,is%20not%20dependent%20on%20any">MVVM</a> architecture, with the exception of User feature, which uses <a href="https://medium.com/quality-content/mvi-a-reactive-architecture-pattern-45c6f5096ab7#:~:text=In%20MVI%2C%20models%20are%20formalized,might%20have%20its%20own%20state.">MVI</a> approach to ease interaction with Compose

<h4>Core module</h4>

- Contains shared resources and utils for all UI feature modules
- Defines the navigation contract of this app, having `MarketplaceNavigator` interface as well as every `NavDestintaion` supported
